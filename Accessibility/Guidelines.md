Guideline for [a11y project](https://github.com/talview/talstrap/projects/1)

- each component a11y would be broken down into two parts:
   - assessment
   - resolution
- Assessment( [template](https://github.com/talview/frontend-standards/blob/master/Accessibility/template.md)):
   - investigate the a11y standards and features for that component
   - assess the presence of that a11y features in talstrap component
   - link to resolution ticket
- Resolution:
   - link to assessment ticket if not already linked
   - implement the a11y features that are listed in the assessment ticket which is not implemented yet
   - create sub tickets according to the need
