# ESLint Standards & Best Practices

Hello, front end engineer!

The main goal of this folder is organize Lint Rules.


## Usage

We ue Airbnb-React as a base for linting rules. These will be extended and a set of custom rules will be added. More information about what linting is and how to use ESLint can be found [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files)


## React Airbnb Rules


You can see how to use linting rules for Airbnb [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb)
and the set of rules [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)


## Using Rules

This [config file](.eslintrc) has a set of agreed rules by the team, feel free to copy them into your project's root folder.
